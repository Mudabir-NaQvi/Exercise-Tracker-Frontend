# Exercise-Tracker-Frontend

# Description

This is the final project of our ten weeks MERN Bootcamp. In this project user will be authenticated to create and track his activities. Every user is going to have default five activities which are **Running**, **Swimming**, **Cycling**, **Hiking**, and **Walking** which, user can see on his dashboard. Each user will have his own activities that he/she created.
Our application is fully responsive with better user experience and user interface. We chose React js along with css to create a frontend design other than using any framework. React js reduced our code redundancy by separating our UI into components which reusable. Our application is very scalable, and in future will be implementing new features like let the user to add/create their own new activity types.

# Features
